Ship Escape
by Kevin Jacobs

This is my first Android game made from scratch using the framework I learned to make from Beginning Android Games by Mario Zechner. Tilt the screen to make the ship dodge asteroids and try to beat the high score!

System Requirements:

  Tested on Android 2.3.7
  Requires Android 2.2 (Froyo)

Compile using Eclipse and the Android API or simply install the .apk included in the repo.
